# ClothesToGather Prototype

ClothesToGather is a web solution that streamlines and personalises users’ fashion shopping experience and reduces overconsumption by listing collection, purchase recommendations, virtual try-on etc.

This repository contains the source code for the [partial prototype / user interface](https://clothestogather.netlify.app/) of the web application which
- collects fashion item data from authorized shops
- extracts item information intelligently and provides searching and filtering functions
- allow shops to edit shop information and item information
- provide recommendations
- provide AI try-on function
- alerts when there is overconsumption

Please check the other [repository](https://github.com/clothestogather/Virtual-Try-On) that has an implementation of the AI try-on function.
